Description
A map of the stone circle. A series of small dark dots mark out the position of the ring.
Plan of the site as it existed in 1905

The stone circle measures 36.4 metres (119 feet 6 inches) in diameter.[21] In 1905, there were 37 stones remaining in the circle.[21] At the time there were conspicuous gaps on the northern and western sides of the ring; the stones perhaps in these areas may have been removed for use as road metal.[22] There are ground depressions where some of these stones have been removed.[23] In 1915 it was reported that one had been removed but that three additional stones had been found in the circle.[24] By 1988, Martin J. F. Fowler reported that there were only 29 stones in the circle.[6] Conversely, the following year the archaeologist Aubrey Burl reported 30 stones, of which three had fallen and 27 remained standing.[5] Originally it may have included around 100 stones, spaced about one metre (3 feet 3 inches) apart.[25]

The stones themselves are small: on average they measure 10 cm (4 inches) in height, 30 cm (one foot) in width, and 10 cm (4 inches) in depth.[5] The largest protrudes about 0.5 metres (1 foot 8 inches) from the ground.[6] Most are incomplete, and likely have been broken since the original erection of the circle.[26] It is not known if all the stones in the circle come from the same natural rock, but a sample from one stone was examined and found to be a hard, pale grey gritstone, likely taken from the nearby Pickwell Down grits.[27] There are conspicuous quartz veins in many of the circle's stones.[27]
Investigation

The site was accidentally rediscovered in 1898 when Archibald Hamilton was riding across Withypool Heath. His horse stumbled on one of the stones, and on further investigation he located other stones within the bracken.[28] After the bracken on the heath was burned by farmers, Hamilton returned to pay closer attention to the circle.[29] He contacted Colonel Bramble, the Vice President of the Somerset Archaeological and Natural History Society, who put him in touch with the archaeologist Harold St George Gray.[4] Gray accompanied Hamilton on a visit to the site in August 1905, when he made a complete survey of the ring.[30]

Gray published his findings in a 1906 volume of the Proceedings of the Somerset Archaeological and Natural History Society, in which he drew comparisons between the site and two Cornish stone circles that he had recently surveyed, Fernacre and Stannon Stone Circle.[31] He suggested that the circle had been the site of cremations, the cremated human remains then being buried within the nearby tumuli.[32] In August 1915, Gray returned to the site.[33] He noted that the circle was in largely the same condition as before, but that the ling and whortleberry bushes around the site were more stunted than they had previously been.[34] Between 1982 and 1985, Fowler visited Withypool Stone Circle alongside other prehistoric stone monuments in Exmoor for a catalogue published in a 1988 edition of the Proceedings.[35]

The site has been categorised as a scheduled monument since 1925, and is thus accorded legal protection under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979.[23][36] In the Historic England database, it is given the listing number of 1021261.[23]
