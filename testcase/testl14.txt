Withypool Stone Circle, also known as Withypool Hill Stone Circle, is a stone circle located on Exmoor, near the village of Withypool in the south-western English county of Somerset. The ring is part of a tradition of stone circle construction that spread throughout much of Britain, Ireland and Brittany during the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age, over a period between 3300 and 900 BCE. The purpose of such monuments is unknown, although archaeologists speculate that the stones represented supernatural entities for the circle's builders.

Many monuments were built in Exmoor during the Bronze Age, but only two stone circles survive in this area: the other is Porlock Stone Circle. The Withypool ring is located on the south-western slope of Withypool Hill, on an area of heathland. It is about 36.4 metres (119 feet 5 inches) in diameter. Around thirty small gritstones remain, although there may originally have been around 100; there are conspicuous gaps on the northern and western sides of the monument. The site was rediscovered in 1898 and surveyed by the archaeologist Harold St George Gray in 1905.

Location

Withypool Stone Circle is located on the south-western slope of Withypool Hill;[1] some sources refer to it as Withypool Hill Stone Circle.[2] The site is 381 metres (1250 feet) above sea level.[3] It is 670 metres (733 yards) east of Portford Bridge,[4] and 4.4 kilometres (2.75 miles) south/south-west of Exford.[5]

The site slopes down from east to west.[4] The topsoil is peaty with heather.[4] A range of different Bronze Age round barrows, a type of tumulus, are visible at different points in the surrounding landscape.[5] There is a lone tumulus 262 metres (286 yards) to the north-east of the circle, on the summit of Withypool Hill, although this is so eroded that it can no longer be seen from Withypool Stone Circle itself.[3] The three Brightworthy Barrows can be seen from the circle in a north-west direction.[3] Other Bronze Age barrows visible from the circle are the Green Barrow, the Old Barrow, the Twitchen Barrows, the three Wam Barrows of Winsford Hill, and the barrow on top of Sherdon.[3]

Also visible from the circle is a scatter of over thirty stones on the Westwater Allotment; these are up to 0.5 m (1.6 feet) long and in 1988 two were reported as being standing.[6] Elsewhere on Withypool Common is a collection of six stones arranged in a rough circle, which may have represented another stone circle or perhaps the kerbstones from a since-destroyed round cairn.[7]

While the transition from the Early Neolithic to the Late Neolithic in the fourth and third millennia BCE saw much economic and technological continuity, there was a considerable change in the style of monuments erected, particularly in what is now southern and eastern England.[8] By 3000 BCE, the long barrows, causewayed enclosures, and cursuses which had predominated in the Early Neolithic were no longer built, and had been replaced by circular monuments of various kinds.[8] These include earthen henges, timber circles, and stone circles.[9] Stone circles are found in most areas of Britain where stone is available, with the exception of the island's south-eastern corner.[10] They are most densely concentrated in south-western Britain and on the north-eastern horn of Scotland, near Aberdeen.[10]

These stone circles typically show very little evidence of human visitation during the period immediately following their creation.[11] This suggests that they were not sites used for rituals that left archaeologically visible evidence, but may have been deliberately left as "silent and empty monuments".[12] The archaeologist Mike Parker Pearson suggests that in Neolithic Britain, stone was associated with the dead, and wood with the living.[13] Other archaeologists have suggested that the stone might not represent ancestors, but rather other supernatural entities, such as deities.[12]

There are only two known prehistoric stone circles on Exmoor: Withypool and Porlock Stone Circle.[14] The archaeologist Leslie Grinsell suggested that the circular stone monument on Almsworthy Common was "probably" the remains of a stone circle,[15] although more recent assessments regard it one of the stone settings, a different form of monument which is more common across Exmoor.[16]

Archaeologists have dated these circles to the Late Neolithic or Early Bronze Age,[17] and have noted that they are comparable to the stone circles found further south, on Dartmoor.[17] In contrast to the two known Exmoor circles, over seventy such monuments have been identified on Dartmoor.[18] This may be because Exmoor, unlike Dartmoor, has no natural granite.[18] Instead it has Devonian slates and Hangman Grits, both of which easily break up into small slabs, resulting in a general shortage of big stones on Exmoor.[18]

This scarcity of large stones may explain why Neolithic and Bronze Age communities used small stones, termed miniliths, in the two Exmoor circles and in other monuments within the region. There are nevertheless other constructions in the area, such as the clapper bridge at Tarr Steps and the three-metre Long Stone at Challacombe, which do use locally sourced large megaliths. This suggests that larger stones would have been available had the sites' builders desired, and that the use of miniliths was therefore deliberate.[19]

Exmoor also has a henge, near Parracombe, although it has been damaged by ploughing.[18] Alongside this, the moor bears a profusion of other Bronze Age monuments, including between 300 and 400 round barrows, standing stones, linear stone rows, and stone settings.[18] The creation of these different monument types might also explain why so few stone circles were apparently created here.[20] Most of the surviving prehistoric stone monuments on Exmoor are located on those areas of moorland outside the limits of medieval and post-medieval agriculture. For this reason it is likely that the surviving sites are not a reliable indicator of the original extent of these sites.[17]
