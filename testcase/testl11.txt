The font display timeline is based on a timer that begins the moment the user agent attempts to use a given downloaded font face. The timeline is divided into the three periods below which dictate the rendering behavior of any elements using the font face.

Font block period
    If the font face is not loaded, any element attempting to use it must render an invisible fallback font face. If the font face successfully loads during this period, it is used normally.
Font swap period
    If the font face is not loaded, any element attempting to use it must render a fallback font face. If the font face successfully loads during this period, it is used normally.
Font failure period
    If the font face is not loaded, the user agent treats it as a failed load causing normal font fallback.
