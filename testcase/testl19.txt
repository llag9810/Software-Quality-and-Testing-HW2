Oh freddled gruntbuggly, 
Thy micturations are to me,(with big yawning) 
As plurdled gabbleblotchits, 
On a lurgid bee, 
That mordiously hath blurted out, 
Its earted jurtles, grumbling 
Into a rancid festering confectious organ squealer. [drowned out by moaning and screaming] 
Now the jurpling slayjid agrocrustles, 
Are slurping hagrilly up the axlegrurts, 
And living glupules frart and stipulate, 
Like jowling meated liverslime, 
Groop, I implore thee, my foonting turlingdromes, 
And hooptiously drangle me, 
With crinkly bindlewurdles,mashurbitries. 
Or else I shall rend thee in the gobberwarts with my blurglecruncheon, 
See if I don't!
